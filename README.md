# akg-ghost

akg-ghost provides extensions to Denis Kudriashov's Ghost package to trace or collect statistics on the messages sent to the target object.

Ghost is a framework which is a "simple implementation of object centric debugging", e.g. inserting a halt on the next message that is sent to the specified object (regardless of which message is sent).

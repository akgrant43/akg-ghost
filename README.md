# akg-ghost

akg-ghost provides a number of extensions to Denis Kudriashov's Ghost package.

Ghost is a framework which is a "simple implementation of object centric debugging", e.g. inserting a halt on the next message that is sent to the specified object (regardless of which message is sent).

akg-ghost extends Ghost to enable tracing and collecting statistics about the messages sent to a specified object.
